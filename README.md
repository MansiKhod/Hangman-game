Hangman Game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. This repository contains a simple implementation of the Hangman game using Python.

Features:

Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
Displays a visual representation of the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses.
Allows the player to input guesses and provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is correct.
Continues gameplay until the word is guessed correctly or the player runs out of attempts.
How to Play:

Run the Python script to start the game.
A random word will be selected from the list, and the hangman interface will be displayed.
Guess letters one by one to try and uncover the hidden word.
For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman will be added.
Continue guessing until you either correctly guess the word or the hangman is fully drawn.
